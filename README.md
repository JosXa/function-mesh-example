# MetaCall Ad Maker Example

MetaCall complete example with Function Mesh between multiple programming languages.

## Motivation

This example has been designed in other to illustrate the differences between a typical Service Mesh like [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo/) and [MetaCall Function Mesh](https://medium.com/@metacall/function-mesh-architecture-c0304ba4bad0).

The complexity of State of The Art of Service Mesh makes so difficult to develop applications. To implement properly a Service Mesh you need multiple knowledge of different areas. The plumbing becomes difficult and tedious, meanwhile with Function Mesh there is no plumbing, only function calls.

MetaCall Core allows to do that function calls between languages, and the plumbing and scalability is automatically done by the FaaS.
